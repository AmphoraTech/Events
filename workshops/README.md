# Amphora Tech Events — Home

This is the home page for **all Amphora tech events**: workshops, meetups, and hands-on sessions. Use it to choose a format, see what’s available, and find the right materials to run an event.

## What are Amphora tech events?

Amphora tech events are structured sessions where people learn by doing: short theory followed by hands-on practice, often in teams. Formats vary from fixed 2-hour workshops to open tinkering with Raspberry Pis. Events can be run standalone or as a series.

## Event formats

### Hands-on workshops (2 hours)

**Format:** 30 min theory + 1h30 hands-on. One topic per event; clear learning objectives and a prep checklist.

**Good for:** Security, cloud, automation, networking, distributed systems. Often use **Raspberry Pi 3** per team (no extra hardware required). Pis can be offered as prizes.

| # | Workshop | Document | Format / Prize |
|---|----------|----------|----------------|
| 1 | Capture the Flag (CTF) on the Pi | [01-ctf-on-the-pi.md](01-ctf-on-the-pi.md) | 2h · Winner gets Pi |
| 2 | Pi as “mini Lambda” — event-driven to AWS | [02-pi-as-mini-lambda.md](02-pi-as-mini-lambda.md) | 2h · First Lambda / best design |
| 3 | Pi as IoT gateway — sensor to cloud | [03-pi-as-iot-gateway.md](03-pi-as-iot-gateway.md) | 2h · First E2E / best dashboard |
| 4 | Lightweight containers on Pi | [04-containers-on-pi.md](04-containers-on-pi.md) | 2h · Smallest image / best trigger |
| 5 | Network scavenger hunt | [05-network-scavenger-hunt.md](05-network-scavenger-hunt.md) | 2h · First correct map |
| 6 | “Event to action” (triggers and side effects) | [06-event-to-action.md](06-event-to-action.md) | 2h · First cloud-triggered action |
| 7 | Tiny distributed system — Pis talking | [07-distributed-pis.md](07-distributed-pis.md) | 2h · First ring/broadcast |
| 8 | Open ideas with Raspberry Pi | [08-open-ideas-raspberry.md](08-open-ideas-raspberry.md) | 30 min presentation + 45 min kickstart + 2h tinkering · Optional: best demo / raffle |

**Practical notes for Pi workshops:** Pi 3 has 1 GB RAM. Pre-flash one SD image per workshop to save time. Teams of 2–3 work well (solo fine for #8). No LEDs or extra hardware needed.

### Other event types (to be added)

- **Talks / lightning talks** — Short presentations; add format and schedule when you run them.
- **Meetups** — Casual get-togethers with a theme; link to past topics and sign-up.
- **Hackathons / challenges** — Multi-hour or multi-day; link to rules and themes when you have them.

Add new formats here as you run them: create a section, link to a doc or folder, and keep this page as the single entry point for Amphora tech events.

## How to use this page

1. **Pick an event** — Choose a workshop from the table above (or another format when added).
2. **Open the doc** — Each workshop has a markdown file with theory outline, step-by-step hands-on, prep checklist, and troubleshooting.
3. **Prepare** — Follow the prep checklist (image, network, handouts) and do a dry run if possible.
4. **Run** — Use the doc as your guide; adjust timings and difficulty to your audience.

## Running a workshop

- **One event, one workshop** — Don’t mix two full workshops in one slot; pick one and stick to it.
- **Handouts** — Each doc suggests “Handout” bullets; turn them into a one-pager or slide for participants.
- **Prizes** — Where noted, Raspberry Pis work well as prizes; decide in advance how to award them (first finish, best design, raffle).

For more detail, open the specific workshop file from the table above.
